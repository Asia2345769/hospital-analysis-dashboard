# hospital-analysis-dashboard
This project focused on analyzing and visualizing hospital emergency room data. I performed data cleaning, transformation, and modeling to extract meaningful insights. Using DAX functions and Power BI, I created interactive dashboards highlighting patient flow, emergency cases, and key performance trends to support data-driven decision-making in hospital management.
